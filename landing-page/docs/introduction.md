## About This Extension

**The Challenge:** Spoken Finnish differs drastically from written Finnish, with unique grammar and slang. Traditional study methods don't prepare you for real conversations. This extension bridges that gap by letting you learn through authentic Finnish media.

**How It Works:** The extension integrates with [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com), a leading translation service widely recognized for its exceptional quality. When you watch a video, Finnish subtitles are automatically translated to your chosen language in real-time and displayed below the original text.

## Key Features

- **Dual Subtitle Display** — See Finnish + translated subtitles simultaneously
- **Multiple Language Support** — Translate to English, Vietnamese, or any language supported by DeepL
- **High-Quality Translation** — Powered by DeepL, known for accurate and natural translations
- **Smart Caching** — Translations stored locally for 30 days; rewatching uses zero API calls
- **Multi-Token Support** — Add up to 2 DeepL API tokens with visual usage tracking
- **One-Click Toggle** — Enable/disable dual subs directly in the video player
- **Shadowing Tools** — Rewind/forward 1 second buttons + keyboard shortcuts (`,` and `.` keys) for pronunciation practice
- **Privacy-First** — All data stays in your browser. Zero tracking.

## Why Setup a DeepL API Key?

You might wonder: "Other dual-sub extensions work instantly—why not this one?"

This extension takes a different approach because you deserve:

- **Best-in-class translations** — DeepL provides high-quality translations for Finnish to 30+ languages
- **Complete privacy** — No data collection, no ads, no tracking
- **Truly free** — DeepL's free tier gives you 500,000 characters/month
- **Sustainable** — No hidden costs or monetization of your data

Yes, it takes 5-10 minutes for one-time setup, but you get premium quality without compromise.

## Completely Free to Use

YLE Areena is free worldwide. DeepL's free API offers 500,000 characters/month. With smart caching, you can learn Finnish without spending a cent.

If you need more capacity, consider upgrading to [DeepL Pro](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro/change-plan#api) — it's a great way to support DeepL's awesome translation technology.
